My name is Joshua Wagstaff-Leon.
All my life I have been around tech, and have always been interested in the inner workings of it.
For the last 15 years I have been programming both as a hobby and in a classroom setting.
I have made small games, math applications, and utility apps for day to day life.
Problem solving comes naturally to me, and I enjoy the process and payoff; I also have a knack for debugging.
The past 3 months I have been enrolled as a student in Boise Codeworks.
I am excited to see what programming concepts I will learn in the future in my career as a software developer.
I look forward to the opprotunities increased programming knowledge will bring.
Flexability and reliability are priority for me; being able to finish projects to a satisfactory level is something I pride myself on.
