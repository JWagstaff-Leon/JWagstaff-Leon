Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?

	S
	My senior enginneer at the YMCA had suddenly left the company, and that left me as the only onsite engineer.
	T
	Keeping up on the work order management, and keeping track of the building was now on me.
	A
	I payed closer attention to things that were not previously part of my job in order to report them to regional engineer.
	R
	I learned more about the operations and methods around the senior engineer position, and was able to start directly helping fix problems with the regional engineer rather than just being assistance.


Tell me about a time an unexpected problem derailed your planning. How did you recover?

	S
	At the YMCA the hot tub pump had gone out, and our water facilities were mission critical, meaning I couldn't leave until it was fixed.
	T
	To get the hot tub pump running so that the water was being filtered.
	A
	I tried many things out on my own that I had seen in my experience. When none of that worked, I called my boss for suggestions, and did what he said. None of that worked either, but I tried them all a few more times. In the end I called the senior engineer, who came and ran through the troubleshooting I had done.
	R
	Because I had so thouroughly troubleshooted the problem the senior engineer was able to quickly determine that the pump was broken, and needed replacing.


Describe a time when you saw a problem and took the initiative to correct it.

	S
	One of our HVAC units at the YMCA kept leaking water into the ceiling, and breaking our drop ceiling tiles, pouring water onto our gym machines.
	T
	FIgure out why the HVAC leaked. It had happened 3 times, and no one knew why, or any environmental reasons why.
	A
	After insepecting the inside of the unit, I noticed that the condenser drip tray was installed in a way that made the ramp in it face against the way our roof was slanted, so that the drip tray ended up being level, preventing it from draining.
	R
	For the remainder of my time working there, the unit never leaked through again.
	

Give me an example of a time you were able to be creative with your work. What was exciting or difficult about it?

	S
	At the YMCA, we had a treadmill that no one was able to determine what was wrong with it.
	T
	Get the treadmill up and running again as members were complaining about lack of treadmills.
	A
	Over the course of about 3 months, whenever I had free time, I would tinker with the treadmill, trying to get it to work. I looked at documentation that I may not have otherwise felt a need to unless I moved up in the company.
	R
	Eventually I followed the pattern of errors down to what was wrong with the treadmill, and get it fixed. Later on another treadmill broke in the same way, and I was able to fix it quickly becuase of the experience.


Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure at work or at school. What was going on, and how did you get through it?

	S
	I worked at a very small Little Ceasar's. I was working till, and there was a saturday afternoon rush where our store got swamped in a very short period of time.
	T
	Trying to keep track of all the orders while balancing time estimates I gave to customers, and help in the back when I could.
	A
	I organized the recipts of people under the cash register in a way I hadn't before, and gave extra focus to remembering who was who, and who ordered what.
	R
	I gave everyone the food they wanted, and we were able to get through the rush relatively smoothly.
