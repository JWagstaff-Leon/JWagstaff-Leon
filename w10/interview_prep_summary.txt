The things you can do to prepare for an interview include practicing code challenges, preparing questions, practicing responding to behavioral questions, and researching the company.
Researching the company will help you get an idea of what to expect before the interview even starts. It will also allow you to have questions that are relevant.
By practicing coding and behavioral questions, you'll have experience in a low stress environment that can transfer to a high stress environment easier. This will allow you to be more confidant, as well as just having experience in general to perform better.
